                    <p>
                        I started my career as a <b>UX/UI Desginer & Frontend Developer</b> at KruxProkon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My role was quiet curical as I had 2 major roles to be played single handed.
                        I was new to desiging at that time, though I has basic idea but I never used any tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started with Figma, initally I was just like all beginners putting spacing and all carefully
                        and
                        then desgining screens, and if any desgin was referrenced then the screenshots where included in
                        the
                        design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After getting the figma ready, I used to communicate with the leads on pointers and then
                        re-tweaking the desgin as and when needed. Once approved starting the Frontend Development.
